# BlueCoat_exploits
Here are 3 metasploit modules I wrote for 3 zero days me and my team discovered back in 2016.
2 of the 3 are on exploitDB, but 1 didn't make it somehow.

These are metasploit modules that worked fine in April 2017.  Maybe one day I'll fork them into rapid7's repository like I did on AlienVault.   Until then - here are the 3 exploits.
