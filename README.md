# BlueCoat_exploits
Here are 3 metasploit modules I wrote for 3 POC zero-day vulnerablities my team and I discovered and published on exploit-db on April 3, 2017.


bluecoat_emailreport_exec.rb --->  https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/41785/

bluecoat_sudo_troubleshooting.rb ---> https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/41786/

bluecoat_sudo_updatecron.rb --->  (exploitDB forgot to post this one somehow)


These are metasploit modules written in ruby.  They should be run within metasploit (msfconsole).  Maybe one day I'll fork them into rapid7's repository.   Until then - here are the 3 exploits.
